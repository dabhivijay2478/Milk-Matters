 ## Backend Repository
 The backend code for this application can be found in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/MunavvarSinan/shoeStore-backend.git). This repository contains the Node.js code for the backend of the application, which handles all the data requests from the app, such as retrieving shoe information and order information.
The backend is built using Node.js and uses a MongoDB database to store all the data related to shoes and orders. The code is designed to be scalable, secure and maintainable.
The backend also includes the integration of Stripe, which is a third-party payment processing platform. This integration allows customers to securely and easily make payments for their purchases. The Stripe integration provides customers with a seamless checkout experience and ensures that all transactions are secure and reliable.
If you are interested in contributing to the backend code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
