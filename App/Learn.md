The Shoe Store Application is built using React Native, with a complete Node.js backend using MongoDB as the database and Stripe for payment processing.

If you're new to React Native, we recommend checking out the official [React Native Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/). It provides a comprehensive guide on getting started with React Native, including setting up your development environment, building your first app, and more.
